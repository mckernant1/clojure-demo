# Clojure Demo
This is a Clojure demo project that uses Leiningen (The Clojure Dependency manager)

## Programming in Clojure
You can program in clojure locally or online.

### Locally
Use the [Cursive Intellij Plugin](https://cursive-ide.com/) and follow their instructions to setup a local REPL within intellij.

You can also install Leiningen at the command line and start a REPL as seen here
```bash
lein repl
``` 

### Online
Clojure REPLs already exist online [here](https://repl.it/languages/clojure)


## Extra Info
